QUESTIONS:
1)Think about how you would make the digit display if you didn't have one. Write out how you 
would approach doing so.

In order to make the digit display you would have to change binary numbers into its decimal 
form, which would then require more logic gates.

2)Make some sort of guess on how that random number generator works? How can things be really
random in a computer with logic gates being so, well, logical?

I don't think it can be completely random. I believe that a computer generates "random" numbers
by taking a seed number and using particular algorithms in order to generate certain numbers,
such as how you use srand() in the language C.
